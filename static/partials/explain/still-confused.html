                            Once you’ve searched for your shows you can choose how you want to watch them - live, day after or binge watching an entire season. Select the service that matches that type of consumption and start to build a package. While you’re at it, choose a device. Or don’t. Maybe you already have one.</p><p> After you’ve selected your services and device, visit our dashboard to see your streaming services, devices and most importantly - total monthly cost. We give you the links to sign up for each service and to buy each device. You don’t purchase anything through us nor do we don’t collect any credit card info (or social security number, blood type or contract for the soul of your first child). We’re just the guys that help you figure out how to watch.
